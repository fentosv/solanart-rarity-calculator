# solanart-rarity-calculator

> Calculates Solanart NFT collections rarity.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run`

Starts the rarity calculation. Doesn't exclude NFT collections already calculated, but update them. (Solana doesn't list the full collection, so it's necessary to scrape the information periodically)
Creates 2 folders in the ``results`` folder: one with the complete rarity information, the other with a version summarized. 

### `npm test`

Calculate the rarity only for one NFT collection, for testing purpouses.

### `npm dom`

Checks if Solanart's DOM has changed.

### `npm trait`

Checks NFT collection traits, for testing purpouses. 

## Usage

* Fill ``.env`` with settings.
* Run the desired commands.
